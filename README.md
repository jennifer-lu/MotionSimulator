# Motion Simulator

Motion Simulator is a program that simulates an object in one-dimensional motion. It displays graphs of the object’s position, velocity, and acceleration and allows the user to pause, play, alter, and reset the object’s motion.


## Prerequisites

Supported operating system versions:
* Mac OS X 10.8.5 or later
* 64-bit Windows 7 or later
* 32-bit Windows 7 or later

### Development Prerequisites

Download Processing 3.5.3 (https://processing.org/download/).


## Installation

Download the application folder for your operating system. For Mac OS X, download application.macosx. For Windows, download application.windows32 or application.windows64 (depending on your system). Uncompress any files after downloading if necessary.

### Troubleshooting

Downloading only the MotionSimulator.app file or the MotionSimulator.exe file will not function unless you have Java 8 or later installed. This is not recommended. For embedded Java 8, download the entire folder.

If downloading a .app file or a .exe file raises impassable security flags, refer to the development prerequisites and installation procedure. Similarly, if installation in this way is problematic, refer to the development prerequisites and procedure.


## Running

Mac OS X:
* Double click the MotionSimulator.app file within the application folder.
* If Finder reports that the application is from an unidentified developer, go to System Preferences --> Security & Privacy and allow the app to run.

Windows:
* Double click the MotionSimulator.exe file within the application folder.
* If Windows Defender or SmartScreen reports that the application is an unrecognized app, select run anyway.


## Development

Drag and drop the source folder, titled MotionSimulator, into the Processing folder on your system (usually stored in the documents directory). Open the MotionSimulator.pde file within the source folder using Processing. This will open the program in the IDE.

### Troubleshooting

If the Processing folder is not present, open and run Processing once. You will be prompted by Processing to automatically create the directory. For further details, visit the Processing website (https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/).

### Exporting

A Processing program can be exported as a .app file (Mac OS X) or a .exe file (Windows). Go to File --> Export Application. The embedded Java option is recommended.
